# Payload Encryption: AES, RC4, and XOR

This repository contains a project focused on payload encryption using three popular encryption algorithms: AES, RC4, and XOR. The goal is to encrypt shellcode to avoid detection by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems and antivirus (AV) solutions.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used for secure and robust encryption of the payload.
- **RC4 Encryption**: A lightweight stream cipher, RC4, offers quick encryption for the payload.
- **XOR Encryption**: A simple yet effective technique for obfuscating the payload, widely used in malware development.
- **Demonstration Video**: Includes a video showcasing the working of XOR and AES encryption techniques.

## Technical Overview

### 1. Payload Encryption
- **AES**: Encrypts the shellcode using a secure key and initialization vector (IV).
- **RC4**: Implements a stream cipher for quick, efficient encryption of the payload.
- **XOR**: A lightweight obfuscation technique to hide the shellcode from basic detection methods.

### 2. Decryption
- **AES, RC4, XOR**: Payload decryption is implemented to restore the original shellcode before injection into a target process.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PayloadEncryption.git
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**: Use Visual Studio or a compatible compiler to build the executable.

3. **Run the Encryption**: Encrypt the payload using any of the supported encryption methods.

    ```bash
    PayloadEncryption.exe <PID> <TID>
    ```

4. **Decryption**: Use the provided decryption functions to restore the payload before injection.

### Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio**: For compiling and running the project.
- **Windows OS**: The project is developed and tested on Windows systems.
- **Administrator Privileges**: Ensure you have admin rights to perform operations like process injection.
